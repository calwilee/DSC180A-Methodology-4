Section A12: Quantifying the credibility of large language model outputs

Mentor: Yian Ma

**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

Using language models to determine semantic equivalency 

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

How to determine aleatoric uncertainty by prompt perturbation in LLMS

**What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

Currently our group is working mostly individually, with each member working on replicating and experimenting with results from their assigned paper. All papers have in common quantifying uncertainty in language models, but we vary in procedure and methodology. I would like to collaborate more for our final report and combine methods later on in this quarter. 

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

Perhaps more token-level methods or self-verbalized methods, I know that some of the prompt perturbation methods may fall under the second category.
